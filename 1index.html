            <p>I am 31 years old and reside in Mid-Wales - Powys.  I work as a Registered Care Home Manager, and have done for approximately 12 years, but who's counting!  I love most things that are stimulating; in particular sports of the extreme</p>
            <p>I got into code in early 2022 as one my siblings had previously completed a Bootcamp and was very positive about it, as well as its prospects.  
                Completed a Bootcamp on Udemy by Dr Angela Yu, which was fantastic, so thought I'd enrol on an 'all singing and dancing' bootcamp with Manchester Codes in order to develop a greater understanding, 
                as well as engage with other link-minded individuals.</p>
